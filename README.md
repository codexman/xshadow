### ☢   Disclaimer!!  ☢

this software may will be useful in the future, but not now.<br>
It's in the designing phase, then dev phase.<br>
thus, please stay away from it.<br>

it requires the following just to do its Normal functions :
+ Full Access to the Internet (Network Connection)
+ It dose tons of operations on the System
+ Root (Administration Privileges) !!
+ It contains a lot of Binaries

It's enough to know that, what this software is capable of.<br>
Any simple issue may turns this software into Harmful Software 😕.

So, if you want to use it, before it's released, then use it at your OWN RiSK !!<br>
### _**`"With Great Power, Comes Great Responsibility"`**_


## TODO:

 _`Powershell`_
 <br>
* [ ] Automata


_`Bash Script`_
<br>
* Front-End
    - [ ] Main Menu
    - [ ] Sub-Menus
<br>
* Back-End
 _`SysV`_
    - [ ] Main Modules `SysV Main Args`
    - [ ] Sub-Modules `inner & outer Args`
    - [ ] Connection `SysV` with `Automata`

### The Core Features, _ that We Should Focus on Are _:
* The ability of selecting by using `VimV module`.
* Having `Settings module` for both `Static` and `Dynamic` Editing.
* The `Theming module`
* And `Open/Close module` for testing `Settings`, `Themes`, `Reload Updates` and `Screen Saver`
* Ability to give the user `Terminal` by the `Terminal module`
* Ability to select `Sizes` and  `Qualities`
* Getting the `Distention` by help of `Automata`
* Ability of `Manipulating Ascii-Arts`


### Side note for _ Automata _ :
* if it can handle `Powershell's Package Manager`, then it'll be excellent
* Especially, if we can get all our binaries and our `Ecosystem` turns into `Unix-like` only by `Automata`

* if the previous points come true, then `Automata` should be capable to `Handle` the following:
    - it should communicate with `SysV` and takes `Signals-like` as Arguments from `SysV`.
    - `Automata` should has a list of all the dependencies `to handle them as signals`,
        and can install them or update them for any reason.
    - the last but not the least is to check for the updates and send `signal` to `SysV`,
        this one `SysV` can take care of it by adding to it an other Module to handle updates and install them,
        but, if `Automata` capable to handle this it will be nice.

### What is our next step after fist Stable Release `V1` :
* Creating Organization and move `XShadow` into it
* Redesigning `XShadow` to be a `Sub-System/Module` for `Cyborg` Project.


### Notes for Next Versions :
*  `V2+`
    * converting `XShadow` into `C-Lang` and then into `Cpp`
    * using New-Curses `C/Cpp` and Support `Mouse`

* `V3+`
    * converting `XShadow` into `Web/Desktop` App
